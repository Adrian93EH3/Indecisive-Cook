# Definition of Agile
In software development, agile (sometimes written Agile) approaches development requirements and solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.

# Team Goals
Our team objectives were to design an app with two API's working together using the agile method.  We used Bulma as our CSS framework to create the UI.  The app decides if you would like to go out to eat or cook at home based upon a boolean value generated by our first API the coin flip.  After a result is generated based on a on.click event by the user they are presented with five recipies with pictures of the dish and links to the recipies in an external database.
